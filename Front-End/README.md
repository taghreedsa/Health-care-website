## Planning and Development Process

We started our health care app by visualization the idea on wireframes , that's lead us to create our front-end & back-end clearly . The beginning step was done by set up the server environment for the app , and by using MVC to arrange the models " User , Posts " & the routes . The second step was to transfer what already done from back-end to the front-end (Our view ) . The work was divided between all the teams members Two of us worked on the front-end one of us worked in the back-end & next day we exchange the roles . That makes the outcome & the result incredibly arranged .
